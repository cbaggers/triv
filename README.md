The trivial packages (triv.*) exist for a stupid reason. They exist because each time I pull in some bundle of utils I dont like how many of them I'm not using. This is the worst kind of premature optimization but I still waste a few seconds each time thinking about it. 

Right now, in the absence of some solution which strips utils based on use, I have decided to at least make the packages as granular as possible.

These packages contain many of the fantastic functions from alexandria & Norvig's PAIP. Those folks did most of the hard work here.
I am slowly collecting utils from each library I find to make this collection as complete as possible.

Also I wanted to read more code written by others so compiling this is an exercise for me.
